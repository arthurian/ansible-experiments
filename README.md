# ansible-experiments
Experiments  for small parts of Ansible so I can test out functions outside of a massive playbook

## Usage ##

All Playbooks are just tasks meant to be run locally. 

Some have required EXTRA_VARS (-e flag) 

Run with:

~~~
ansible-playbook -c PLAYBOOKNAME.yml -e EXTRA VARS
~~~

## Participate

Pull requests welcome.

Experiments should be short and sweet. Do one thing and do it well!
